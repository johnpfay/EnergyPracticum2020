  - This report talks about potential barriers to adoption, which I think we  need to consider in order to have a comprehensive picture of the  existing infrastructure we’re entering in
  - It also offers recommended locations and shows how they ranked locations by the greatest need of EV chargers
- Seems like a guy named Todd Wilson developer a location analysis mapping system to identify all the existing chargers in NC[ http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/seuc15/papers/seruc_64.pdf](http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/seuc15/papers/seruc_64.pdf)
