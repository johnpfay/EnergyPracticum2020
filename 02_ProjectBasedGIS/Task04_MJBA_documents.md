# MJ Bradley & Associates' *EV Infrastructure Tool*

Navigate to the site: https://www.mjbradley.com/content/electric-vehicle-infrastructure-planning-tools-1 and you'll see a product that addresses an objective quite similar to the one we are tackling in our practicum. This resource, developed by [MJ Bradley & Associates](https://www.mjbradley.com/) (an energy/environment consulting firm centered in Boston and DC) provides a unique opportunity to accelerate our project's development by building off what they have already done for the northeast and mid-Atlantic states. 

To capitalize on this opportunity, I want you to ==**delve into MJBA's materials and compare ideas we've generated as a class**== to those portrayed in their EV Infrastructure tool. We're fortunate in that they provide ample documentation, but even after skimming them, you may have some questions. To that regard, I have arranged for Grace Van Horn, a lead developer on MJBA's EV Infrastructure project, to pay a virtual visit to our class. My hope is that Ms. Van Horn will answer any questions you may have and also shed light on the process she and her team went through to get to the product we see today. As such you should ==**come to class next week with whatever questions you may want to ask regarding MJBA's EV Infrastructure tool**==.

## Topics of note

While you are sifting through the material, some points to consider are listed below. See if you can answer them from the materials above. If not, you might want to ask Ms. Van Horn...

* Evaluating all streets and roads from Maine to NC for EV infrastructure would be wildly impractical. What subset of roads and streets did MJBA select for their project and how did they arrive at that decision? 



* What metrics are used to evaluate EV infrastructure decisions (slides 5 & 6 of the slide deck). 

  * How is each metric measured? In what units are they measured? 
  * How are the distributions of actual measurements scaled to values between 1 and 10? Equal interval? Deciles? Other?
    * See https://www.axismaps.com/guide/data/data-classification/
  * Are there metrics here that you didn't consider before? Are there others that you think should be included here? 

  

* The tool offers 6 different weighting schema (slide 8 of the slide deck, section 2.1.5 of the User guide). What are the rationales behind these weighting schemas and do you agree with them? How might these be verified?



* Looking at the EV Infrastructure Location Identification Tool, what datasets are included. Are there any you are surprised to find? Where do you think these layers came from? Might they be available for us to use?
