# MJB&A Notes

### Questions

* Genesis of the project: What was the original objective and how did you translate that into the tool you produced?
* Where there other questions/analyses you dismissed? Why? Impractical? No data? 
* Are there other spatial analyses you would have liked to include? Datasets you wish you had? 
* Who will be using this tool? What has been its reception? How do you envision its future? 
* What have been in the biggest challenges in putting this together? What does your team look like?

* Slide 3: Actionable restatement of problem objective:

  > Support states and other stakeholders in assessing fast charging along transportation corridors and priority locations for charging stations.

* Slide 4: Data collection:

  * 9k miles of "key PEV corridors"

    > What constitutes a PEV corridor?
    >
    > * Federal corridor == Interstate system?

  * Existing DCFC infrastructure? Filtered to locations w/in 5 miles of freeway corridors.
  * Focus on interstate exists and other "key intersections"
  * Allude to work with participants

  > Which terms are vague? 

* Slide 5: Key Metrics

  * Proximity to existing charging
  * Commercial activity
  * Population
  * Traffic density

  > How to measure? What units? Cutoff? Weighting?

* Slide 6: Methodology

  * Proximity: relative (ranking). Near is bad; Far is good

    > Improve by setting cutoff relative to capacity of PEV

  * Population @ exit:
