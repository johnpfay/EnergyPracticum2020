## Objectives

* maximum profit generated by charging stations?
  * attract investment
* maximum population served?
  * population = drivers
  * population = community
  * current vs future population (drivers|community)
* minimize cost
* avoid restrictions (environmental/physical/policy)

## Factors

* Population centers
* Proximity to powerlines
* Proximity to sources of electricity
* Proximity to gas stations
* Parking lots
* Airports
* Schools
* Office buildings
* Affluent areas
* Urban areas
* Traffic \# of PEVs on road: now and projected
* Incentives/policy



### Demand

* Cars/travelers/traffic
* Population
* EV range
* Fuel cost
* Ease of access

### Supply

 * Infrastructure (businesses/amenities)
 * Power supply (distance/capacity)
 * Available land | land cost

### Restrictions

* Floods
* policy
* Pollution
* Noise
* Safety

### Opportunities

* Policy incentives
* Economic revitalization
* Highly polluted area
