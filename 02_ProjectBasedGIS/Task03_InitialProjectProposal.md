# Initial Project Proposal

So far, we've given some thought to our central question of how to design a passenger electric vehicle charging network across North Carolina. Next we want to organize our thoughts into a coherent **project proposal**. 

Use our discussion of project based GIS alongside what you've deemed important to the central question to outline a workflow for how might proceed with the project. Your proposal should include the following:

* ##### A clear definition of the central question in actionable terms, clarifying any vague terms as best you can into ones that data + analysis might be able to address. Adhere as best you can to what you interpret the central question is asking, but take liberties to amend the question so that it's answerable. 

* ##### A set of sub tasks that make your overall project goal more manageable.

* ##### A list of the data required to answer the question [for each sub task]. If you don't think it's likely that such data exist, suggest a **proxy** dataset that is more likely to exist and can be used with minimal additional assumptions.

* #####  A sketch of how you might present the results of your analyses [for each subtask]: maps, tables, plots, charts, text...

* ##### Any additional comments, notes, or questions not covered above but that might help move your project to a useful result.

You will likely amend this initial proposal as you get more information, but having a solid initial plan goes a long way in speeding your analysis and getting a useful result. We will review these proposals together and learn from each other.
