## Introduction

One time I was asked to map priority areas in central North Carolina for conservation. I was a GIS expert, so it should be easy for me to map that with the help of my expensive software.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the necessity and process of planning a spatial analysis project
* See where GIS fits in the greater workflow of a project; 
* Learn to "think like a computer" and review the capabilities and limitations of spatial analysis



---

## 1. Define problem

* Main objective: what is your central question?
* Sub-objectives: what would answer your central question?
* Actionable objectives: how will you answer your question? 
* Deliverables: how will you communicate your results?
* Assessment: how will you know if you succeeded or failed?

## 2. Plan of attack

* Analytical workflows
* Data needs & sources

## 3. Attack/Analysis

* Workspace organization
* Sprints and adjustments

## 4. Synthesis

* Write up results
* Interpret and discuss in terms of central question

## 5. Post mortem

* Important lessons learned from hindsight
* Share your results, your analysis, your knowledge with others
