# Project Based GIS

## Introduction

Many often think of GIS as the solution to a problem when really it's just a tool that may help you find the solution. Often overlooked is the need to redefine or restate a project objective into something a computer can actually process, something I call "making the project actionable". This often includes identifying all vague terms in an initial project question and figuring a way to  assign a specific value to it. For example, suppose you were asked to count "all fast food restaurants near Interstate 40". That may sound straightforward enough at first. However, you can't really answer this without knowing what "near" is. 500 meters? 3 miles? The choice may alter our result quite significantly -- or it may not...

This section on "Project Based GIS" addresses this and other issues that need to be resolved before moving forward on a geospatial project. Here, we examine GIS less as a technical tool and more as a piece in a larger workflow (the technical part will come later). We review a framework that enables us to move efficiently towards a specified objective and how best to leverage the power of GIS along the way. 



## Learning Objectives

* Understand the necessity and process of planning a spatial analysis project
* See where GIS fits in the greater workflow of a project; 
* Learn to "think like a computer" and review the capabilities and limitations of spatial analysis

## Discussion: Steps in executing a spatial analysis project

### 1. Define problem

* Main objective: what is your central question?
* Sub-objectives: what would answer your central question?
* Actionable objectives: how will you answer your question? 
* Deliverables: how will you communicate your results?
* Assessment: how will you know if you succeeded or failed?

### 2. Plan of attack

* Analytical workflows
* Data needs & sources

### 3. Attack/Analysis

* Workspace organization
* Sprints and adjustments

### 4. Synthesis

* Write up results
* Interpret and discuss in terms of central question

### 5. Post mortem

* Important lessons learned from hindsight
* Share your results, your analysis, your knowledge with others
