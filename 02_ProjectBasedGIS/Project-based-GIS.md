# Project Based GIS



## Introduction

> Fun flick revealing potential challenges in being the "technical expert": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg

Many often think of GIS as the solution to a problem when really it's just a tool that may help you find the solution. And like any tool, it's just one piece in a larger process aimed at getting something done. In this section on "Project Based GIS", we examine GIS in the context of this larger framework, one that includes envisioning exactly how GIS may be used, on what data, and what the results should look like. Understanding GIS from this perspective should allow you to use it more efficiently and avoid wasted time and resources, and allow you to benefit from your hard work even if your results aren't exactly what you had hoped for. 

### Learning Objectives

* Examine what GIS is and what it is not.
* Understand the necessity and process of planning a spatial analysis project.
* See where GIS fits in the greater workflow of a project.
* Learn to "think like a computer" and review the capabilities and limitations of spatial analysis.

## What *is* GIS? 

* What is <u>**information**</u>? 
  * The "[DKIW Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid)"...
* What is an **information** **<u>system</u>**? 
  * Data + hardware + software + people
* What is a **<u>geographic</u>** **information system**?
  * Information system where the data has a spatial attribute...
  * 

## Expectations: What a GIS can do and what it can't... 

* Computers are "dumb" and deal in absolute specifics
* Computers are <u>much</u> faster than humans in certain tasks
* *People* design processes, not computers
* Processes require *data*; we must provide the data
* Garbage in = garbage out



## Where does GIS/spatial analysis fit into the larger project workflow?

## Steps in executing a spatial analysis project

### 1. [Re]define the problem; make it "actionable"

* Main objective: what is your central question?
* Sub-objectives: what would answer your central question?
* Actionable objectives: how will you answer your question? 
* Deliverables: how will you communicate your results?
* Assessment: how will you know if you succeeded or failed?

### 2. Plan of attack

* Analytical workflows
* Literature review; expert consultation
* Data needs & sources

### 3. Attack/Analysis

* Workspace organization
* Gather data
* Sprints and adjustments

### 4. Synthesis

* Write up results
* Interpret and discuss in terms of central question
* Communicate results

### 5. Post mortem

* Important lessons learned from hindsight
* Share your results, your analysis, your knowledge with others

## Examples

I've recently engaged in two projects that provide good examples of bridging client requests with actionable projects. These two projects dealt with solar farms and hog lagoons, both in SE North Carolina. Below are the two central questions originally posed with each project. 

#### Central questions:

<u>Solar farm siting</u>: `What are the potential impacts on habitat loss and fragmentation associated with land conversion in the creation of new solar farms?`

<u>Hog lagoon prioritization</u>: `Which hog lagoons in southeast North Carolina are best suited for the installation of anaerobic digesters?`



#### Moving the project forward:

Those two questions certainly required much further clarification before they could become actionable projects. The first then was to have follow-up conversations with the clients to narrow in on vague terms, and when they could not be more specific, I moved forward by making my own calls. 

> <u>For discussion:</u> what clarifications do you think are needed in each question?

To move this project forward, I compiled the following documents for the two studies. 

* [Outline-SolarFarms.html](./Outline-SolarFarms.html)
* [Outline-HogLagoons.html](./Outline-HogLagoons.html)

Review each of these documents to explore the decisions needed to move these forward. Your next task will to apply this approach to our EV Charger project...
