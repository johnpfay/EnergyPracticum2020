# Discussion: Sharing project proposal ideas

Today's objective will be to discuss our individual project proposals and perhaps find some consensus on what types of analyses we might do in this class. We will go around the class and compile a list of:

* #### Actionable central questions

* #### Defined Sub-tasks

* #### Data requirements

* #### Deliverables

Some of you may have nailed exactly what needs to be done to move forward effectively. Others may have objectives that need more precise definition. This discussion will provide the opportunity to clarify what exactly we should start doing. 

Following this assignment, we will be examining an existing tool developed by a consulting agency that is quite similar to what we might have decided to do. This gives us a unique opportunity to "check our work" or at least compare notes. More information on that tool will be provided *after* we've made our own attempts to define our project based analysis.
