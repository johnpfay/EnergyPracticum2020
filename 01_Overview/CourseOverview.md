# Course Overview

[toc]

---

## Central task

#### "Design an optimal plugin electric vehicle (PEV) charging network for North Carolina..."

---

## Course objectives

This GIS practicum teaches GIS/geospatial analysis from a project-based perspective. We take a central task and use GIS to tackle that task. In doing so, we:

* Discuss approaches and best practices for using GIS in a project setting
* Examine and execute various geospatial analyses that may be useful in tackling the central task
* Compile and present results and 
* Assess how successful we were at meeting our initial objectives and discuss ways to improve the overall analysis

---

## Learning objectives

Over the course of this practicum we will explore the various topics, gaining at least a base level of proficiency:

* **Project based GIS: Framing a task into a geospatial task**
  * Breaking down the central tasks into actionable sub-tasks
  * Developing GIS workflows
  * Finding, obtaining, and organizing data
  * GIS "best practices"
* **GIS technologies: ArcGIS Online & ArcGIS Pro** 
  * Vector data models & analysis
  * Raster data models & analysis
  * Network data models & analysis
  * Geoprocessing model builder
  * Story maps and web applications
* **Additional technologies (as needed and time permitting)**
  * Python and the ArcGIS Python API
  * Spatial analysis in R
  * Versioning and GitHub

## Course expectations and assessment

We will meet once a week, Thursdays from 3:05 to 4:20pm, in LSRC A153. Classes will be a mix of lecture, discussion, and computer exercises in the first half of the semester, and supervised project time in the latter half. Students are expected to and will be assessed on:

#### ♦ Attendance and active participation in class sessions (10%)

* Arrive to class promptly and come prepared for the day's activities
* Engage in class discussions and workshops
* Be courteous to others and encourage discussion 

#### ♦ Research journal (25%)

* Compile thoughts on various assigned "prompts" in a single document, blog, or other format.
* Write concisely and keep on topic, but do not worry about being "wrong".
* *See below for more information...*

#### ♦ GIS exercises (25%)

* Complete the assigned exercises in a timely fashion.
* Submit answers to challenges posed.

#### ♦ Submitting and presenting final project report (35%)

* Professional looking; not rushed or sloppy
* Reflects thoughtful and well-applied analysis
* Documents data sources and steps taken
* Answers the central question clearly and convincingly
* Includes discussion on the overall analysis and thoughts on further improvement

#### ♦ Peer evaluation & Course feedback(5%)

* Constructive comments supporting and criticizing others' work.

* Constructive comments supporting and criticizing how the class was run.

## Your Research Journal

One requirement of this course is to maintain a <u>research journal</u>. This journal provides an opportunity to: 

* practice communicating your experiences, ideas, questions and goals in writing 
* describe and examine the trajectory of your research
* synthesize what and how you are learning
* consider your individual contribution to a team and how the team is functioning as a whole
* ask questions about the research process
* examine what you do well and enjoy about the research process and where you might improve
* articulate a path forward towards future research goals

Throughout the semester, I will provide a number of topics for journal entries. These serve to prompt your thought process and don't have any right or wrong answers. You are encouraged to be frank and candid in your entries. Revealing uncertainty, naivety, or ignorance on a certain topic is actually a <u>good</u> thing here, especially when followed up with thoughtful discussion on how to proceed from there. 

By the end of the course, your journal should enable you to reflect on the entire evolution of the project as well as store useful notes on specific GIS operations that may be helpful in subsequent spatial analysis projects. You will submit your journal at the end of the course. At this stage, your journal should reflect the arc of your learning throughout this class. While it's primary purpose is to serve as a resource for "your future self", it should be clearly enough organized such that others (like me) can follow your learning process throughout the semester. More specifically, your journal should emphasize the following: 

* *Clarity*: You clearly express complex ideas and provides illustrative examples. Writing is concise and to the point.
* *Logic*: You follow an argument or line of reasoning to conclusion, identifying areas for further inquiry and reasonable routes towards your research goals.
* *Depth*: You articulate the complexity of a research question or problem and make relevant connections.
* *Perspective*: You examine a problem from multiple points of view and assimilate perspectives/experiences from outside this course to bear on the central question.
* *Significance*: You draw conclusions and articulate the significance of your findings.

We will discuss in class the best **format** of this journal (Word Document? Sakai Blog? Wordpress? Weebly? Wix?),  and you have flexibility in which format you decide works best for you. Again, you should not be concerned with looking naïve or ignorant in your journals; being correct is not an objective. Rather it should more reflect the process of problem identification, problem solving and the skills you picked up along the way.
