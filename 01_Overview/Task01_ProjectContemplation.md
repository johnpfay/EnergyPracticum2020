# Project Contemplation...

Your first assigned task for the class is to contemplate the practicum's central question of siting electric vehicle chargers across North Carolina. Some of you may have already given this significant thought, but most of you haven't really thought about this much at all. 

Below are a few prompts to get you thinking about this question. Spend some time thinking about these and jot down your thoughts in your **research journal** (this will be your first entry). <u>Come to the next class prepared to discuss these questions and any other related thoughts/questions/ideas you have</u>.

* #### Create a list of factors that might go into locating electric vehicle chargers.

* #### What data or additional information might be useful to have in our analysis?

* #### Find 3 or more on-line resources that might be useful for this task.

* #### Describe elements of your particular background that might contribute to this project.

* #### Are there any particular skills you especially wish to get out of this course? 



Tim Johnson will be visiting our class next session. He has far more experience on this topic than I do and will be a great resource to ask question that will propel our research question forward. <u>Use whatever ideas enter your head to formulate questions for Tim that might prove useful for identifying the next steps in our analysis</u>. 

* #### Generate a list of questions to ask Tim Johnson next week.

  > Hint: An upcoming task asks you to generate a list of "next steps" for starting to plan a charging network. Ask Tim questions that might help you with that task...
