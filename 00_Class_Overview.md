# Energy GIS Practicum - Course Overview

This is the first ever NSOE GIS Practicum - a new type of course that teaches GIS using an applied approach. Here, we begin with a central research question, and then work collectively to answer that question using spatial analysis. As your instructor, my role will be to assist you in answering this question. I will offer advice on how we might best approach the central question, explain what geospatial analyses might useful, and provide instruction on how those geospatial analyses are executed. 

We will not likely cover every facet of geospatial analysis in this course, as some techniques will not be relevant to what we need to accomplish. However, I rather than just apply the techniques we need in a cookbook fashion, I will take opportunities to explain the techniques we use in enough detail such that you will gain a broader understanding of the fundamentals of GIS and best practices for running spatial analyses. 

Over the course of the semester, we will use a variety of technologies. Certainly, we will use ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Pro, but we will likely also look at how geospatial analyses are run in a coding environment, using Python and the ArcPy package and possibly using R and its geospatial analysis packages. 

It is important that you understand that these practicums are more student-driven than other GIS course and perhaps than most courses at NSOE.  You play a large role in deciding your learning pathway and in moving the project forward. And while I will play an active role in this class, you are encouraged to consider me as a resource in helping you answer the central question rather than a de facto project manager. 

You should also understand that my background on the central question, on the field of energy is quite limited. We will therefore rely on your collective backgrounds, bringing in guest speakers, and researching the topic ourselves to fill the gaps. 

  

## Course topics

While the list of specific geospatial tasks will be determined as the course unfolds, the course will present a number of base GIS concepts. These will likely include:

* GIS project design
* Using ArcGIS Online to locate, view, and analyze spatial data
* Using ArcGIS Pro to locate, view, and analyze spatial data
* Spatial data types: vector and raster data models

We will
