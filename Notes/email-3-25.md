Hi Energy GIS'ers, 

We've worked many of the initial kinks out of delivering on-line courses, and I'm looking forward to our class tomorrow. Here's an outline of what is in store:

* We will "meet" via Zoom tomorrow at our regularly scheduled slot (3:05 - 4:20). The link to the Zoom meeting is on Sakai, in the Zoom Meetings section, but just in case, here it is as well:  [https://duke.zoom.us/j/10323120](https://duke.zoom.us/j/103231206).

* If for whatever reason you're unable to join the Zoom session, it will be recorded and I'll post a link to the recording on our class site. 

* We'll spend the first part of the class time just ensuring everyone has what they need to keep moving forward. 

  Compared to other GIS classes, our requirements are much more manageable: we really just need access to our ENVIRON859 virtual environment (https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers/environ859). *However, it you/we determine that access to ArcGIS Pro is useful, I can set you up with an ArcGIS Pro enabled virtual machine. We can discuss that in class.* Meanwhile, the files and applications we need for how I envision us moving forward are all accessible via the virtual environment, which we can access via any web browser. 

* For any remining time of the class tomorrow, we'll begin tackling the set of tasks I've laid out for what's left of our semester...

About that - i.e., what remains of the semester - we actually don't have many meetings left, only 3 in fact. *(NOTE: We will NOT meet April 2nd because of MEM talks, but the school as added a week to the end of the regularly scheduled semester...)* I had hoped to build a tight lesson plan that would drive us forward toward completion of our intended objective, but with far too much of my time absorbed by helping the school shift to on-line teaching, I came up a bit short on that plan for our class. Instead, I've reconciled that the best path forward will be for me to power us through a scaled down, but somewhat complete analytical workflow for our EV siting challenge. It's far from perfect, but it should still give you hands on experience working with Python, GIS, and working with spatial data that will be useful beyond our class. 

So, here's my plan: 

* I've created a document, "Moving Forward" (https://johnpfay.github.io/EnergyPracticum2020/Moving-Forward.html) that outlines this analytical workflow. **Please read this over prior to class Thursday so we can have an informed discussion on it.**
* Time permitting we will also begin a series of tasks in class. These include:
  * Cloning the "EV_Charger" repository to your virtual environment. This will be an "answer key" containing finished results of the various tasks we will run through. 
  * Setting up a project workspace to do our own complete analysis.
  * Download data required for our analysis
  * Running the various analyses

I highly doubt we'll have time to do all those activities in class, so I've also made some recordings of each. You'll see links to those recordings on our class web page. More will come on-line as I complete them. And that's the way the remaining semester will proceed: I will assign tasks that you will complete on our own, but with help of videos I provide, and with Q/A occurring in our remaining class sessions. 

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, is recognition that everything is weird right now, and that I am happy to accommodate whatever needs/constraints you are facing. Graduate classes have been moved to pass/fail for good reason, and as far as I'm concerned, you all have demonstrated passing work already, so if you want/need to concentrate on other challenges you're facing, I'm good with that. Of course, if you want to remain engaged at whatever level, I will do what I can to make good use of that time. 

And please, if you have any questions or concerns or just want to voice your thoughts or suggestions on this class or anything, don't hesitate at all to reach out - email, zoom, whatever. 

Best, 

John
