# Sequence

1. ### Intro

2. ### Think about question: what is important?

   * Study the problem: consult client/experts, literature review

3. ### Focus into an actionable project

   * Clarify objectives 
   * Identify subtasks - construction plan

4. ### Gather intel about the central question

   * Revise project scope
   * Identify useful geospatial analyses

5. ### Learn how to execute geospatial analyses

   * Platforms (Online vs Desktop)
   * Data models (vector, raster, and other)
   * Vector analyses
   * Raster analyses

6. ### Project work

   * Find and organize data
   * Execute analysis
   * Synthesize and communicate results
   * Evaluate success and revise analysis

## Analyses

* Establishing planning units - sites to be scored, ranked, evaluated, prioritized
  * Exits along interstates
  * Tessellated squares or hexagons
* Distance from existing DCFC - Not too close, not too far
  * Euclidean
  * Network
* Site feasibility
  * Footprint, available space
  * Accessibility to power
  * Cost to link power 
* Amenities 
  * Services within walking distance
  * Destinations within radius
* Demand - enough cars to justify expense
  * Traffic
