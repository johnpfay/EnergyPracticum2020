# Course Overview



## Central task

#### "Design an optimal plugin electric vehicle (PEV) charging network for North Carolina"



## Course objectives

This GIS practicum teaches GIS/geospatial analysis from a project-based perspective. We take a central task and use GIS to tackle that task. In doing so, we:

* Discuss approaches and best practices for using GIS in a project setting
* Examine and execute various geospatial analyses that may be useful in tackling the central task
* Compile and present results and 
* Assess how successful we were at meeting our initial objectives and discuss ways to improve the overall analysis



## Course expectations and assessment

We will meet once a week, Thursdays from 3:05 to 4:20pm, in LSRC A153. Classes will be a mix of lecture, discussion, and computer exercises in the first half of the semester, and supervised project time in the latter half. Students are expected to and will be assessed on:

* Attending and actively engaging in class discussions (30%)
* Completing assigned tasks (30%)
* Submitting and presenting final project report (40%)



## Course proficiencies

* **Project based GIS: Framing a task into a geospatial task**
  * Breaking down the central tasks into actionable sub-tasks
  * Developing GIS workflows
