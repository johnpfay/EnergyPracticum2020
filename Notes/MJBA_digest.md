### MJ Bradley & Associates -Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Planning Tool

#### Objective

"Support states and other stakeholders in assessing fast charging along transportation corridors and priority locations for charging stations"

* Optimal locations for new DC Fast Charging (DCFC) sites along major corridors

#### Approach

* Collect data on existing DCFC infrastructure
  * Sites located within 5 miles of corridor
  * Focus on interstate exits & other key intersections
* Work with regional agencies to improve dataset
* Ranking based on:
  * Existing infrastructure: {Proximity: distance & density}
  * Commercial activity: {# of restaurants, bars, gas stations w/in 1 mile}
  * Population: density of surrounding census tract
  * Traffic density: average annual traffic volume
* Assigned attributes to each exit
* Devised weighing system - weighted ranking of each exit
* Visualization tools

---

#### NOT included

* Identify traffic gaps: stretches of road that are > X mi from a charger (where X is typical range of PEV)
* Urban charging for lower range vehicles

---

#### Other explorations

* Design of gas station networks, of Tesla's network: what was though process? 
* Machine learning: attributes of existing gas stations
