# Learning Pandas

We will use the [Geo-Python](https://geo-python.github.io/site/index.html) site to learn Pandas.  

### 1. Navigate to [https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L5/overview.html](https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L5/overview.html)

There you will see a set of lessons for learning Pandas as well as a video capture of the lessons being taught by a pair of instructors. 

### 2. Get the notebooks and data for the exercise. 

Here we have two options. First is to use the **MyBinder** site to run the exercises and the second is to upload the exercises to your ENVIRON859 Jupyter environment. 

#### → MyBinder

* Navigate to the first page of the exercises (https://geo-python.github.io/site/notebooks/L5/exploring-data-using-pandas.html). At the top, you'll see a set of three icons to open the exercises in various formats; Click on the **`launch|student binder`** link at the top of the page. This will open a new Python notebook session in ***mybinder.org***. 

  When this opens, you'll have an active Jupyter notebook matching the one in the Geo-Python lesson, but with the code left blank for you to type in. 

  > Note: If you leave your MyBinder session alone for too long (10 minutes), it will time-out and you can't get your work back. To backup your notebooks, you can right-click on them in the left-hand panel and select Download...

#### → ENVIRON859 Jupyter Environment

* Navigate to your ENVIRON859 environment (https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers/environ859) and log in. 

* Open up a new terminal window by clicking`New|▼` and selecting terminal. 

* In the terminal window type the following command:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/geo-python/notebooks.git
  ```

  > This will download ALL the Geo-Python lessons to your environment, found in the new folder called "notebooks". The Pandas exercises are in the `notebooks/notebooks/L5` folder. 



### Run through the exercises and come to class with any questions. 

* The corresponding notebook on the Geo-Python site has all the "answers" if you get stuck.

* We are going fast here, so don't expect to understand everything. If you get stuck with something, just type the command as seen in the Geo-Python site. Maybe it'll make sense later, or perhaps you need to discuss it with me or another classmate. And remember, there's a video that comes with this lesson...
* But do strive to get an understanding of the logical flow of the steps and think in terms of objects|properties|methods. 
* Also, note patterns in code snippets and build a mental library of various important statements. 
* Lastly, don't forget to experiment!
