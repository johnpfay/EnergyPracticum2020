## Project ideas

* Identify gaps in traversing the state along interstates

  * Start at each DCFC nearest state border
  * Travel 100 miles: which routes end (no charger found in 100 miles)?

* Create an app to predict where you can go on XXX charge

  * Convert charge to miles
  * Identify chargers within radius
  * Identify service areas (by iteration)

* Build a graph/edge list among existing DCFC (OD Cost matrix)

  * Remove edges above a threshold 
  * Compute connected graph? 
  * Change threshold and compute diameter
  * Compute centrality scores? 
    * Betweenness = importance as stepping stone
  * Same analysis with Exits? Candidate sites added?
